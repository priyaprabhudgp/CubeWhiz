# Rubiks-Cube-Solver
- Got the colour grid and string input mapping code from [Link](https://varunpatil.github.io/Rubiks-Cube-Solver/) (We developed the image mapping and used a more efficient algorithm)
- This Solver uses the Kociemba algorithm to solve a Rubik's Cube efficiently
- Before running this program on your device, please install the TwoPhase Library and verify that server.js references the Python version you have
- We developed this on VS Code

**Directions**
- Clone the GitHub repo
Terminal:
- install npm
- install the twophase library
- run npm start
- Copy-paste the localhost link into the browser
